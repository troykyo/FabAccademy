	<p>
	The <a href="http://mtm.cba.mit.edu/machines/stages">previous reconfigurable stages</a> were made out of aluminium and polymetal, but to make it quicker to prototype motion we designed a version of the stages made out of tri-fold cardboard, the kind you use for science fair displays. These stages can be used to experiment with configurations before making a final machine design, or used as the final machine itself. <a href="http://monograph.io/james/m-mtm">We have another spot for documentation here.</a>

	The stage is folded out of laser cut tri fold cardboard, which we have been calling SCIENCE. The <a href="http://mtm.cba.mit.edu/machines/science/doc/mMTM_Linear_CRD_003.3dm">rhino model</a> is parametric, and you can adjust the model to accomodate different thicknesses of cardboard to generate different cutfiles.

	</p>

	<p>
	The fold lines are scored on the laser, while the rest is cut through. Here are our <a href="http://mtm.cba.mit.edu/machines/science/doc/CRDBRD_STAGE.dxf">cutfiles</a> for the SCIENCE cardboard listed on the <a href="http://mtm.cba.mit.edu/machines/science/doc/scienceBOM.pdf">BOM</a>, where blue lines are cut through and red are scored. We used 60% speed and 50% power at 1000 pps for cutting, and 100% speed and 15% power at 500 pps for scoring on a 150W CO2 laser.

	They use motors with integrated lead screws, anodized aluminium rods as guide shafts, and nylon bushings. <a href="http://mtm.cba.mit.edu/machines/science/doc/scienceBOM.pdf">Here is the current bill of materials</a>.

	We are still using gestalt to prototype the control systems. <a href="https://github.com/imoyer/gestalt">You can download the latest gestalt library here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/imoyer/086-005">the schematics for the control boards here.</a>
