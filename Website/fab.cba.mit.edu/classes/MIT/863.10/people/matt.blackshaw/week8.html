		<h5>The idea</h5>
		<p>
			This week I made a capacitive touchpad with an ATTiny44 micro controller which
			measures input voltage on a number of copper pads using step response.
		</p>
		
		<h5>Testing step response</h5>
		<p>
			To fully understand step response and its precision I milled
			and stuffed Neil's demo step response circuit and ran it with the
			code he provided. Unfortunately the first time I programmed the
			micro controller I set the low fuse to 0x7E telling it to use an
			external clock (ooops!)... Because the circuit didn't have one,
			the chip was rendered lifeless. David Mellis suggested hooking up
			an external clock to the correct pins, but I instead opted for
			replacing the ATTiny45 through unsoldering (hint: use a hot air gun
			, they're AMAZING).
		</p>

		<h5>Circuit design</h5>
		<p>
			Once I had a grasp of step response I designed my own circuit
			which had 8 step response inputs. I used an ATTiny44 because it
			has 8 pins hooked up to the analog to digital converter
			through an on-chip analog multiplexer. I thought that the
			ATMega168 would offer even more analog input pins, but it unfortunately
			does not... To get more pins I would've had to use a separate
			analog multiplexer, though (according to Neil) there was a risk of
			introducing additional circuit parasitics, so I opted for the easier
			8-pin on chip design.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was also my first experience routing a circuit using Eagle.
			Because I was using all 8 pins on the ATTiny44 and I'm OCD and wanted
			everything routed on the board (instead of using jumper wires) the
			process took some time. I'm also a big fan of Eagle's autorouter which
			can be run using the 'auto' command... It produces acceptable results,
			which I then fine tuned by hand.
		</p>
		<p>
			Milling and stuffing the board went off without a hitch. It's getting
			easier!

		<h5>Touchpad design</h5>
		<p>
			With 8 inputs I figured I could use 4 columns and 4 rows of copper pads
			to get 16 points of resolution. After playing with several designs (and
			at Neil's recommendation), I settled on the design below which actually
			allows for 31 points of resolution through detection of more than 2
			rows and/or columns. I cut the design on the vinyl cutter and fixed it
			to a piece of birch plywood then soldered on cables and a couple of
			2x4 pin headers to connect to the circuit board.

		<h5>Programming the micro-controller</h5>
		<p>
			After starting with Neil's step response code, deciphering the data sheet,
			and a couple of helpful pointers from David Carr, I worked out how to
			change the analog multiplexer input	port and read voltage using step response.
			I found the 1us voltage reading to vary the most when touching a copper pad so
			I used a touch down threshold voltage of 700 and a touch up threshold
			voltage of 750 (on a scale of 0-1023, the output from the A/D converter).
			Because the 1us reading was deterministic in determining a touch I discarded
			the 10us and 100us readings. I also found that sending the voltages over serial
			for every step response cycle was much slower (due to the 10ms delay on each
			character send being much greater than cycle time) than checking voltages against the
			threshold on-chip and then sending touch down/up events over serial.
		</p>
			
		<h5>Visualizing the output</h5>
		<p>
			Similar to last week, I used NodeJS to read output from the serial port which
			is sent to the browser using a WebSocket and visualized using ProcessingJS.
			My visualization shows the location of a persons finger as it moves across the
			touchpad. To make the movement more smooth (due to the low resolution) I chose to
			animate between touch points. All code for visualization is provided below.
